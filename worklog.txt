Week1.step1:
- VAP has 1MB of memory and VPB 32MB, they have two differents processors: arm926 (VAP) and cortex-a8 (VPB)
- The bss 16-byte alignment comes from how the assembly was written in reset.s to zero the bss section, because the assembly write 4 registers at a time,
  each of 32bits, so 4*4-Bytes = 16 bytes. 

Week1.step2:
- The period output Zzzz.... is executed only when the count is greater than 100000, because even if the  uart_send_string() function is blocking, the
  output would be too fast if we removed the 'if clause'. 
  If we removed the period output Zzzz.... the second while doesn't have instruction, so become an infinite loop that wait for a character, then the
  character will be printed and the loop starts again. 
- Push an element and then pop it, if the result is the element that we have push before the stack is working properly
- The Program stack will be full, so if we added others functions, the space won't be sufficient and the overflow will be detected.
- The C program can be executed more safely if we use a MMU, because it is safe respect to overflow, reduce the difficulty to grow/shrink. In general, it's   impossible to be sure that the program is safe, because overflow and halt can happen.

Week1.step3:
- To emulate a second serial line I add a new QEMU machine with this new parameter: QEMU_SERIAL2=-serial mon:telnet::4321,server=on,wait=off
- This new machine can be debugged at port 1234 and the telnet port is 4321.
  In a third window I run the command "telnet localhost 4321", this window will be the output of my application.
  In order to print byte values representing the encoding of the typed characters on the keyboard, I modify the function kvprintf, adding the function
  putchar -> static void kputchar(int c){  
                                          uart_send(UART1, c);   //Print a single character
                                        }
                                                 
- When I hit the regular characters and other special characters (delete, backspace, ecc...) the result is the ASCII code of that character. If instead I
  hit the arrows, the result is different, it returns three different number where the first one is the ASCII value of the left arrow, the second one is
  the value of '[' and the last  one is different for the 4 arrows, this last value is between 65-68.                                                 


Week1.step4
- Using the QEMU_SERIAL2 configuation, I tried to emulate a shell.
 In particular: - use a while ( 1 == uart_receive(UART0, &c)), differently from the previous one, it work every time a chacter is hitten.
                - if we write "reset" all the lines of the shell will be deleted
                - if we wite echo and then a word, the word will be printed in the next line
                - before press return, we can also modify the line: delete the characters, move right and move left.
                - every time we hit return, we save in a matrix the printed line. Thanks to this matrix, we can use the up and down arrow to dispaly the 
                  last 20 lines entered.
